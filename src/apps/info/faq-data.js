      summary: 'How does Mati verify my users?',
      details: `
Mati offers a whole suite of checks to make sure that you stay compliant.

**Liveness**: make sure you collect the real face of your user, and not a printed piece of paper (like most fraud to get online credit).

**Face Match**: get a proof that the user's face matches the face on the document.

**Document reading**: collect most important fields from document (full name, date of birth, document number)

**Watchlists check**: make sure that your user is not flagged in any global watchlist.

**Alteration detection**: make sure that the uploaded document was not modified by the user.

**Template matching**: make sure that the uploaded document matches a valid revision from its country of origin. This feature is available in certain countries only. If you need more details, please contact us.

      summary: 'I could finish Mati verification with the document of a friend. Is it normal?',
      details: `
Yes. Itâ€™s because all the checks Mati performs are made on our backend. We usually do not block users on the SDK side for UI/UX reasons. 
But if something is wrong in the verification, Mati will let you know on the backend side once you integrated our webhooks.
